Homework 14 SQL Table Design

Assignment Description

Tonight's homework will involve designing tables in SQL Server Management Studio.

Create one table to collect Employee Information for a new hire. What fields would you include? What data types for those fields should you use?

Design two tables that demonstrate the relationship between an individual author and her book, with at least four fields in each table.

Design three tables to illustrate the following relationship:
  An animal shelter needs to keep track of their adoptions.
  They would like to keep information for each animal (type of animal, breed, and three other fields)
  Each family who is adopting (whether or not they have a fenced in yard, if they have other pets, and three other fields)
  And a record of each adoption (which family adopted which animal, the date of the adoption, and three other fields).
